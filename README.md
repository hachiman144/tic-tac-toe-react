# React Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a demo project, where a user can play Tic-Tac-Toe with a very clever Node.js server.

This project uses React 17.x, Node.js 14.x

### Special Notes
I have to make shotcuts specially in creating proper object for managing the game variables.
Also I have to simplify the logic in detemining the winner. 

### Error cases
As far as errors are concern. I already handled errors that could prevent the game from running.
Runtime errors or bug could occur in the game. Which can prevent it from running desirably

### Installation
This set of steps currently only starts up the *dev* server, but it should suffice as a demo.
1. Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed
2. Clone this repository.
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/mmatthews06/react-tic-tac-toe.git
 ```
3. Install Node modules:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
 4. Run the API server:
  ```bash
  node server/index.js
  ```
 5. Run the front-end:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
 6. If a browser does not open up immediately, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
